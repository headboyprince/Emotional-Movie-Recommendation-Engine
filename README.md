# Emotional-Movie-Recommendation-Engine
A simple movie recommendation system that allows users to filter movies based on their preferred emotion type, and whether they prefer *classic or modern movies*, and whether they prefer *short or long movies*. It then returns a randomly selected movie from the filtered list and generates a list of movie recommendations based on the selected movie using **cosine similarity**.
